Sleeping barber problem
All TODO done and changed to DONE

Notes:
- queue.task_done lets workers say when a task is done. Someone waiting for all the work to be done with Queue.
- has a bug where it loops on the last function.
- change the euro sign in the last print stmt to "Barbers payment total:" due to an error that arose in my terminal for being non-utf-8.
