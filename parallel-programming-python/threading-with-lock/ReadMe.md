Using the Python 3 threading library to create a **binary lock** and a number of threads to independently use the lock to enter execution of a "critical" section of code. 
Feel free to modify numbers of threads to see the various effects this can have.  

Run:
  1. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  2. python3 start_new_thread_example.py -n 3, which in this case will cause 3 threads to be started.
